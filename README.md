This is my portfolio website written using Reactjs and Bootstrap along with a bit of CSS styling, it is still a work in progress. 
To visit the website, please go to https://bryansan1226.github.io/
To view the code, please navigate to the master branch. The gh-pages branch is the default branch for building the website for Github Pages. 
The website is responsive to different screen sizes on desktop screens, I will work on making the website more mobile-friendly soon.
